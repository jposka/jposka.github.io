				<p>Our research lies at the intersection of material science, mechanical engineering and electrical control systems.
					We predominantly develop “smart materials,” many of them inspired by nature. These multifunctional material systems are able to sense and adapt to changes in their environment. Our research group members are involved in the modeling, design and manufacturing of these materials from start to finish. </p>



			<p>	We are currently designing a dynamic mobile prosthetic device actuated by artificial muscles made of twisted and coiled carbon fibers. These artificial muscles can lift up to 12,600 times their own weight, doing 18 times more specific work than natural muscles.</p>

				<p> We have also built a texture-modulating device that mimics the self-morphing abilities of cephalopods like octopi. Currently, we are adapting this “smart skin” for several applications related to hydrodynamics. </p>

				<h4 class="contact">Our Major Ongoing Projects</h4>

				<p><b>Dynamic Mobile Prosthetic Device:</b> We are currently designing a prosthetic wrist using artificial muscles that contract in response to electrothermal stimulation. These artificial muscles can lift up to 12,600 times their own weight and do 18 times more specific work than natural muscles.</p>

				<p>To make the muscles, we dip carbon fibers in a solution of PDMS (a silicone-based polymer) and hexane. We then over-twist the cured composite to induce spontaneous coiling. The twisted and coiled artificial muscles are able to undergo axial contraction in response to electrothermal energy.</p>

				<p>Some group members are currently optimizing the physical frame of the prosthetic device with CAD software and 3D printing, while others set parameters to optimize performance of the muscles. We hope to consolidate the frame, muscles and control system into a usable device soon.</p>

			<p>	<b>Self-morphing “smart skin”:</b>  We have built a texture-modulating device inspired by the self-morphing camouflage abilities of cephalopods like octopi. This “smart skin” mimics the shape-shifting bumps on cephalopod skin, sensing and adapting to changes in its environment. </p>

			<p>	The skin is powered by artificial muscles made from commercially available fishing line. We coat twisted fishing line is coated in copper, then coiled it into flat spirals, sandwiched between two layers of elastomer. The spirals uncoil and spring upwards in response to electrothermal energy.</p>

				<p>We are currently adapting the smart skin for several exciting applications. One is to increase turbulence around underwater machines to create help create lift when necessary.  Another is to reduce drag for underwater machines by replicating the structure of hydrodynamic shark skin. The skin will also be used as an “anti-fouling device” to flick off buildup of microorganisms on the hulls of ships.</p>

			<p>	In the future we hope to explore the color-changing camouflage abilities of cephalopods as well.</p>

			<p>	<b>Nanomechanical characterization:</b> We are able to characterize the mechanical properties of materials using a nanoindenter. The machine calculates elasticity, hardness and toughness of materials by creating indents in their surfaces.</p>

				<p> This process furthers understanding of materials on the nanoscale to inform future applications. Our research group is currently testing nanomechanical properties of laser-treated aluminum surfaces and a semi-conductor that can be used in flexible electronics.</p>
